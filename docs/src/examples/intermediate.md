# Intermediate example

This section introduces some more advanced examples that include using some of the external solver libraries that are interfaced through CADDEE to perform physics-based analyses such as the vortex lattice method (VLM), blade element momentum (BEM) theory, beam models, and others.
Examples will also include simple optimization problems.
