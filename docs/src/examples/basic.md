# Basic examples

In this section, we introduce several examples to explain the concepts in CADDEE. These example are meant to run quickly and require little computational resources as they generally involve no or only simple geometries and simple (physics-based) solvers. First, we illustrate how to build a component hierarchy in CADDEE in Example 1.1. Component hierarchies can be visualized at the `Configuration` level via the  `visualize_component_hierarchy` method, which can produce an image like the one below.
```{figure} /src/images/component_hierarchy.png
:figwidth: 90 %
:align: center
:alt: caddee_classes
:target: ../_images/component_hierarchy.png
```
Next, we expalin how to define mass properties and how to use configurations to manange components and their attributes.
